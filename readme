------------------September 14th, 2013------------------This was done for the first project of my data structures and algorithms class. The algorithm recursively checks all k-length (k = # of unique characters in input string) digit combinations for summation puzzles like this:a + a = bCheck: a = 0, b = 1		0 + 0 = 1 FALSECheck: a = 1, b = 0		1 + 1 = 0 FALSERemove 0 from list of numbers to check, add 2, and repeat.Check a = 1, b = 2		1 + 1 = 2 TRUECheck a = 2, b = 1		2 + 2 = 1 FALSE......
